# Autocomplete backend

## Idea
- Search/Autocomplete API
- load in words, ranking, cache, api layer

## Notes for future me 
- don't have trailing spaces in makefiles 
- using namespace is bad practice :P -- I guess it makes sense. I think typedef is kinda in the same category but not as univerally frowny.
