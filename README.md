# Autocomplete backend 

## In-progress
- Wrote trie with insert, delete, search, prefix search
- Wrote basic test suite for trie functions
- Using Google Test / Google C++ Testing Framework for tests 
- Using Cmake for the first time (can still compile with makefile but have not edited it to be compatible with gtest yet)

## Idea
- Search/Autocomplete API
- load in words, ranking, cache, api layer

## Notes for future me 
- don't have trailing spaces in makefiles 
- using namespace is bad practice
